# Hello!

I'm David Silva Sánchez. A PhD student in Applied Mathematics at Yale University. This is a compilation of software development projects related to cryo-EM where I have collaborated or acted as the leading developer.

* [cryo-EM Ensemble Optimization with cryoJAX](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/cryojax-ensemble-optimization) (Main developer): A physics-guided ensemble optimization method for fitting ensembles of atomic structures to single-particle cryo-EM images. Built with cryoJAX and OpeMM. Preprint coming soon.

* [Cryo-EM Heterogeneity Challenge](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/Cryo-EM-Heterogeneity-Challenge-1) (Main developer): Preprocessing and Analysis pipeline for the Cryo-EM Heterogeneity Challenge. Developed the preprocessing pipeline, and the PCA metric. [A preprint describing the challenge and the results can be in bioarxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.07.18.665582v1).

* [cryoJAX](https://github.com/mjo22/cryojax) (Collaborator): A flexible and differentiable simulator for cryo-EM data from volumes or atomic structures. Generates data compatible with Relion / Cryosparc. Developed the interface for atom-based volume representations, and the interface for reading PDB files and Relion datasets.

* [cryoSBI](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/cryoSBI) (Collaborator): A simulation-based inference pipeline for estimating the posterior probability of conformational structures given cryo-EM data. Set the basis for the initial design of the API, and collaborated in testing/developing the current API. Results available in our (PNAS article)[https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2420158122].

* [AnaVox](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/AnaVox). Adapted the PCA pipeline from the Cryo-EM Challenge for the analysis of volume series obtained by different heterogeneity methods. See our [preprint] for results.

* [Observation on Kmeans](https://github.com/DSilva27/Observation-on-kmeans): Theoretical study on the behaviour of Lloyd K-Means in the high noise, high dimension regime for a simple k=2 GMM Model. A description of the theory and numerical experiments can be found in our [manuscript in ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14952).
